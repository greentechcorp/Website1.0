          We seek to form an inclusive workforce that embraces the diverse communities we

          We believe that integrity is the foundation for our company on which coworkers build
          relationships, trust, honesty and effective interpersonal relationships. We strive to
          always act just and right, work truthfully and honourably, thus maintaining high ethical
          standards, even when no one is watching. We hold ourselves accountable for choice

      to constantly improve and innovate. We are not afraid to make mistakes. We
      proactively use them as an opportunity to share and learn. We work to challenge one
      another to push boundaries and think beyond the box to have an impact in this

          advocates and to improve the health and happiness of the world. We are committed
          to incorporate recyclable materials and renewable energy from local sources
          whenever possible. We actively consider the environment in the choices we make
